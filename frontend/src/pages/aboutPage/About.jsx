          Hey, I'm Marko Ivezic, and my journey has taken me from the basketball
          court to the world of economics and technology. Born in Serbia, my
          early years were defined by my passion for basketball. I kicked off my
          career as a professional player, pouring my heart into the game.
          Sadly, a twist of fate cut that chapter short when I faced an injury
          at the tender age of 20. <br />
          <br />
          Resilience became my middle name. Shifting gears, I delved into the
          realm of economics. Back in Serbia, I earned my master's degree,
          channeling my energy into projects aimed at bolstering the local
          economy. It was a different kind of court, but the goal remained the
          same—development and progress. <br />
          <br /> Fast forward to the present, Paris became the backdrop for my
          next venture. I found myself in the dynamic field of
          telecommunications, contributing to the installation of 4G and 5G
          networks. It was a technological leap, and I was right there,
          hands-on, making it happen. But, as they say, the learning never
          stops. That's why I decided to add another skill set to my repertoire.{" "}
          <br />
          <br /> Enter Ironhack—a journey into the world of MERN stack
          development. It was a challenge that I embraced, and by the end of it,
          coding became my new court, and I was the player navigating lines of
          code instead of dribbling on a hardwood floor. From the highs of the
          basketball court to the intricacies of local economic development and
          the fast-paced world of telecommunications and tech, my story is a
          testament to adaptability and the pursuit of new horizons. Who knows
          where the next jump shot will take me? Life's full of surprises, and
          I'm ready for the next play.
